## Introduction

üåü **Pioneering the Future of Video Compression: The Wamboo Initiative at Harmony Valley** üåç

Harmony Valley embarked on its journey in April 2022, driven by a core mission to revolutionize video compression. Recognizing the substantial energy consumption associated with video data, the project proudly introduced two groundbreaking applications: the eco-conscious Wamboo app for Android users and the innovative Wamboo eco-cam. Notably, the publication "Green Video Compression for Metaverse: Lessons Learned from VP9 and HEVC," for SMPTE Media Technology Summit, rigorously examines motion estimation inefficiencies in these established standards while presenting viable enhancement approaches.

In tandem with our commitment to progress, we have released the comprehensive source codes for both Android applications and the motion estimation algorithms of VP9 and HEVC in Matlab. These resources include detailed energy efficiency metrics and computation count calculations. As part of our collaborative ethos, we offer these tools to all impassioned researchers, fostering their active participation in our collective objective.
